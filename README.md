# Coronavirus analysis

This repo analyzes the activity of coronavirus hashtags on twitter. You can see the results, how often each hastag was used by country and language, in the viz folder. The data is from October 2019 through March 2020. The files ending in .country are the number of occurances of the hashtag by country and the files ending in .lang are the number of occurances of the hastag by language. The reduced.country and reduced.lang files in the repository are the totals of the hastags by country and language. I have also created a line graph showing the use of #corona over time by some countries in graph.png, also displayed below. I took the natural log of the occurances so that they could all be shown nicely in the same graph.
